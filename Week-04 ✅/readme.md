# 🐍 Python Internship – Week 04 Tasks

This folder contains all the tasks I completed in **Week 04** of my Python internship.
This week’s focus was on **advanced algorithms, recursion, data structures, and graph-based problem-solving.**

## 📋 Task Details

### 🔹 Task 1: Binary Search

* Implemented the Binary Search algorithm to efficiently find the position of a target value in a sorted list.
* Practiced the divide-and-conquer approach for faster searching.

## 🔹 Task 1: OUTPUT

## 📅 Week Summary
## This week was all about **binary search**, **matrix multiplication**, **recursion**, **character frequency counting**, and shortest path finding with **Dijkstra’s algorithm** in Python.
I learned:
- How binary search improves search efficiency
- Matrix multiplication using nested loops
- Solving recursive problems like Tower of Hanoi
- Using dictionaries to count occurrences of characters
- Applying Dijkstra’s algorithm to find shortest paths in graphs
