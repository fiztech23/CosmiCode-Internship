'Lost time is never found again.' — Benjamin Franklin
I still remember my favourite teacher words: 'Time is flying'
That thought has never left my mind; life is moving so fast
that it feels as if he said it just yesterday, even though
many years have already passed. And perhaps that is why
the words are true.
Time is flying. It truly is!
Life itself is tied to time.
Every moment we lose is a piece of life we can never live again.
