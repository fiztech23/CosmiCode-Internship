        "That thought has never left my mind; life is moving so fast\nthat it feels as if he said it just yesterday, "
        "even though\nmany years have already passed. And perhaps that is why\nthe words are true.\nTime is flying. It truly is!")

# Append more data
file.append("\nLife itself is tied to time.\nEvery moment we lose is a piece of life we can never live again.")

# Read file
file.read()
