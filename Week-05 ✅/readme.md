# 🐍 Python Internship – Week 05 Tasks

This folder contains all the tasks I completed in **Week 05** of my Python internship.
This week’s focus was on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)** concepts in Python, **including classes**, **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, **operator overloading**, and **file handling**.

## 📋 Task Details

### 🔹 Task 1: Bank Account (Classes & Objects)

* Defined and used classes and objects to model a bank account.
* Implemented deposit, withdrawal, and balance methods.
