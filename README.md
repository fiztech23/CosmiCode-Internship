## 🚀 CosmiCode Internship – Python Programming Journey

This repository contains all the tasks and projects completed during my 6-week Python internship. Each week covers different core programming concepts, gradually moving from basics to advanced topics, and finally a complete project.

📝 Overview of Weekly Progress

Week 1 → Learned Python basics: printing, arithmetic, conditions, working with shapes and time.

Week 2 → Focused on mathematical logic: prime numbers, Fibonacci, factorization, GCD/LCM, and Kadane’s algorithm.

Week 3 → Strengthened data structures & string handling with sorting, reversing, palindromes, and text analysis.

Week 4 → Implemented algorithms: binary search, matrix operations, Tower of Hanoi recursion, frequency counting, and shortest path in graphs.

Week 5 → Built strong OOP concepts: classes, inheritance, polymorphism, operator overloading, library management, and file handling.

Week 6 → Worked on advanced concepts like decorators, exception handling, JSON, multithreading, asyncio. Completed the Final Project – Expense Tracker App with GUI, database, and visualization.

🎯 Final Project – Expense Tracker App

Features:

Add, view, and categorize expenses

Store data in SQLite database

Generate visual reports (pie charts by category)

GUI application with Tkinter

Modules Used: sqlite3, tkinter, pandas, matplotlib

Impact: This project combined everything learned during the internship into one functional, real-world application.

🙌 Personal Note

This internship has been a highly valuable experience. By progressing step by step through weekly tasks, I was able to strengthen my fundamentals and gradually apply them to larger problems.

The Final Project – Expense Tracker App especially helped me integrate database management, GUI design, and data visualization into one solution.

Overall, this journey improved not only my technical skills but also my confidence in handling projects independently, making me better prepared for future professional challenges.
