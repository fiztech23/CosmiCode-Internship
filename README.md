📆 Weekly Highlights

✨ Week 1 → Python basics (intro, arithmetic, shapes, time conversion)
✨ Week 2 → Number theory & math (prime, Fibonacci, GCD/LCM, Kadane)
✨ Week 3 → Data structures & text handling (sorting, reversing, palindrome, longest word)
✨ Week 4 → Core algorithms (binary search, matrix ops, Tower of Hanoi, Dijkstra)
✨ Week 5 → Object-Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance, polymorphism, file handling)
✨ Week 6 → Advanced Python + Final Project (Expense Tracker App)

## 🎯 Final Project – **Expense Tracker App**
💡 What it does:

* Add, view, and manage expenses 💸
* Store records in SQLite database 🗄
* Generate visual reports (pie charts by category) 📊
* Interactive Tkinter GUI app 🎨

🛠 Tech Stack: **Python, SQLite3, Tkinter, Pandas, Matplotlib**

## 🙌 Personal Note

* This internship was more than just a set of tasks — it was a journey of growth.

* From writing simple Python programs to developing a complete Expense Tracker App, I learned how to:

* Break down problems into manageable steps 🧩

* Combine database, GUI, and data visualization in one project 💻

* Build confidence in solving real-world challenges 🌍

* I truly appreciate this experience — it has made me more skilled, independent, and ready for future opportunities. 🚀
